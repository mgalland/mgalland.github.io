In coordination with the [Mozilla Foundation Science lab](https://science.mozilla.org/) and together with the DTL community manager [Mateusz Kuzak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateusz-kuzak-b548a714b/), I co-founded the Amsterdam Science Park Study Group to gather computational biologists working in Science Park at the University of Amsterdam. The group now regularly gathers researchers from IBED and SILS to perform demonstrations of  bioinformatic and computational tools, train experimental biologists, solve issues and coordinate actions in computational biology.
