# Short introduction

Since September 2023, I am employed as an INRAE Plant Research Scientist ("Charg√© de Recherche") working at the Institute for Genetics, Environment and Plant Protection (UMR IGEPP) in Le Rheu (Rennes, Brittany, France). My aim is to understand the genetics and molecular basis of _Pisum sativum_ (pea) and _Vicia faba_ (faba bean) resistance to aphids from the _Acyrthosiphon pisum_ and _Aphis fabae_ species. This knowledge should help to create cultivars less susceptible to aphids and aid to augment the cultivated area of leguminous species helping in turn agriculture to become more sustainable.  

From January 2019 to May 2023, I was working as a full time Data Scientist at the University of Amsterdam working closely with early career plant researchers at the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences.
I helped fellow scientists on all aspects of data from Research Data Management, "Omics" Data Analysis to applications of Machine Learning/Deep Learning to find leads or speed up tedious tasks (e.g. counting objects from images). 

To promote best practices in scientific programming and promote Open Science, I lead a small community of programming scientists that aimed to organise training courses and co-developped tools. This community is called the ["Amsterdam Science Park Study Group"](www.scienceparkstudygroup.info) has a dedicated Slack workspace, a custom-made website and was awarded twice by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) in 2020 and 2021. It is still currently active by [board members](https://scienceparkstudygroup.info/who-we-are/).

## Community building and guidance
Since 2017, I coordinate a small group of biologists willing to make progress in scientific programming (data visualisation, genomics, statistics, etc.). It is called the [Amsterdam Science Park Study Group](https://www.scienceparkstudygroup.info/). Together with recruitment of new members and contributors, I co-organize code-related events for computational biologists such as Carpentry workshops, Summer Schools or I make sure that regular one-hour sessions take place (every two weeks) and participate in lesson development.
