# Short introduction
I am a support data scientist at the University of Amsterdam (Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences) helping fellow researchers on Research Data Management and Data Analysis. On a daily basis, I work mostly with Plant Scientists that are struggling with various (plant) genomics and other "omics" issues. I also participate in a pilot project at the University of Amsterdam to implement the [iRODS](https://irods.org/) Open Source Data Management Software together with a graphical use interface called ["YODA"](https://yoda.sites.uu.nl/) developed by the University of Utrecht.  

To reach out to more scientists and gather a community of computational life scientists, I also coordinate a Mozilla Study Group called the ["Amsterdam Science Park Study Group"](www.scienceparkstudygroup.info).    

Last but not least, I am an official Software and Data Carpentry Instructor from the [Carpentries Foundation](https://carpentries.org/). As such, I regularly organise scientific programming and data analysis workshops for researchers to teach them good practices in programming and data science.

## Community building and guidance
Since 2017, I coordinate a small group of biologists willing to make progress in scientific programming (data visualisation, genomics, statistics, etc.). It is called the [Amsterdam Science Park Study Group](https://www.scienceparkstudygroup.info/). Together with recruitment of new members and contributors, I co-organize code-related events for computational biologists such as Carpentry workshops, Summer Schools or I make sure that regular one-hour sessions take place (every two weeks) and participate in lesson development.
