# Short introduction

Since 2019, I am a full time Support Data Scientist at the University of Amsterdam working closely with  early career life scientists at the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences.
I help fellow researchers on all aspects of data from Research Data Management, "Omics" Data Analysis to applications of Machine Learning/Deep Learning to find leads or speed up tedious tasks (e.g. counting objects from images). 

To promote best practices in scientific programming and promote Open Science, I currently lead a small community of programming scientists that aims to organise training courses and co-develop tools. This community called the ["Amsterdam Science Park Study Group"](www.scienceparkstudygroup.info) has a dedicated Slack workspace, a custom-made website and was awarded twice by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) in 2020 and 2021.       

Last but not least, I am an official Software and Data Carpentry Instructor from the [Carpentries Foundation](https://carpentries.org/) since 2018. As such, I regularly organise scientific programming and data analysis workshops for researchers to teach them good practices in programming and data science.

## Community building and guidance
Since 2017, I coordinate a small group of biologists willing to make progress in scientific programming (data visualisation, genomics, statistics, etc.). It is called the [Amsterdam Science Park Study Group](https://www.scienceparkstudygroup.info/). Together with recruitment of new members and contributors, I co-organize code-related events for computational biologists such as Carpentry workshops, Summer Schools or I make sure that regular one-hour sessions take place (every two weeks) and participate in lesson development.
