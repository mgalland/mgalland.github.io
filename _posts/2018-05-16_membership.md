I am reading the book of Emily Webber entitled ["Successful communities of practice" (TACIT press)](http://successfulcommunitiesofpractice.com/buy-the-book/)

## First step: answering questions about the community (what defines it?)
**What role is this community for?** 
The Data Clinic community of practice points to a need in support in data analysis and bioinformatics.
This need is based on my own experience: I was a wet-lab biologist in need of training & support but also of a community to discuss and benchmark my code-related research.   
Now, at this point, I see that this community would not only adress Master and PhD students needs but also provide a vocational training for PIs and Professors, something that I had not envisionned at the beginning.   

**Are there any existing connections you can build on?**
Yes, for instance, Pietro Marchesi (SILS, Cognitive Neuroscience) is already organising some workshops on statistics and data analysis.  
Some people in the Molecular Plant Phytopathology group (SILS) were having R-oriented sessions in the afternoons. Maybe I should reactive these R themed sessions.  
There is also a computational task force led by Emiel van Loon (TCE-IBED) that I should try to contact.      

**What are the broad vision and goals of the community?**
The broad vision should be "aspirable", "achievable" and "easy to understand"	

Goals should be SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timely. 

What are the SMART goals: 
- Organising 2 to 3 Carpentry workshops every year. Maybe appoint someone responsible for that. 
- Developping two new Carpentry lessons every year. Based on the priorities listed by the Data Clinic Scientific Council (composed of groups interested in data analysis and scientific programming).
- Create and update a website for the Data Clinic
- Set-up one code-review afternoon per week: this would be to prepare publishing & benchmark scripts before publication. 
- Set-up one helpdesk session: assist beginners during office hours. 
- Organise the SILS & IBED "week of code": gather a wish list (issue bonanza) and set-up a one-week Hackhaton where the wish list is being implemented.

The community members should also help to shape these goals! 

## Second step: defining who belongs to the community

When should someone be part of the community?

(purpose) If the person shares the same work goal then this person should be part of the community. For instance, Emiel is teaching RDM to students which is also a goal of the community. 

(challenges) If a person shares the same day-to-day challenges than the community, then this person is a person to recruit. This is typically Pietro or Like. 

(learning) If a person is likely to learn new skills by being part of the community, then this person should be part of the community. Probably beginners such as Fred or Grace are definitely recruits. But also Zsofia because she is scientifically curious. 

(teaching) If a person is likely to learn something useful for his/her day-to-day work then this person should join.
