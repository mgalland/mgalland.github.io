This post is also inspired from the book of Emily Webber ("Building successful community of practice").  
Who should do what in the community?


Each person is the lead for an activity. He/she can request support from the Community. Either from the core team (Executive Board) or from more 

I am just shaping my thoughts here. 

## Core team
- Like: Carpentry organiser (teaching): Like because she is a certified Carpentry Instructor 
- Zsofia: Create and maintain the Data Clinic website: because she is interested in gaining new skills (HTML/CSS)
- Mariette: Organise Research Data Management events
- Huub/Emiel: helpdesk
- (all) Advertisement: 
	- update the mailing list every year to include staff and temporary students
	- sends reminder emails for activities 
	- 
- Joyce: hire new members beneficial for the group
- 

The advertisement could and probably should be spread among individuals responsible for organizing their events.
