title: "Starting your own company in the Netherlands"

For some time now and after some discussion, I decided to start my own data analysis company and named it "biodata services". The domain name **www.biodataservices.nl** is registered but I need to build the corresponding website and come up with a portfolio of the related activities!

# Registering at the Chamber of Commerce *Kamer van Koophandel*
Registering as Sole Proprietorship *zelfstanding ondernemer* (also called *eensmanzaken**) is simple, cheap (50€) and rapid (~30min). All you need to provide is:
- An adress where to affiliate your company
- A name for your company. 
- a description (in dutch) of the company activities
- 50€
