title: Online resources for scientific programming

Because of these corona-days, I have made and sent around a list of useful online resources to learn programming and data analysis using R and Python. I hope it is useful for others as well.


## Data analysis with R

* What I'd recommend is to suscribe to DataCamp and enroll in the [data analyst with r career track](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-analyst-with-r).
* The [Modern Dive online book is also very complete and thorough](https://moderndive.com/index.html).  
* The other option, less extensive, is to self-study Carpentries-style courses: 
  * [https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/open-science-with-r/](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/open-science-with-r/). 
  * [https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/git-Rstudio-course/](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/git-Rstudio-course/).
 
## Bioinformatics and Python programming
* [A great book to get started](https://vincebuffalo.com/book/). 
* The [Software Carpentry lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) are not per se on bioinformatics but rather give a set of good practices and basic programming skills.
* Whenever you want to install something on your computer, the [conda software manager](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists/index.html) is a great and easy solution for that.

## Omics
* [This lesson on RNA sequencing](https://scienceparkstudygroup.github.io/rna-seq-lesson/) still in its infancy but already run once!  
* The official [Data Carpentry genomics lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/). 

## Various topics
* [A very nice image processing lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/ )
* [A presentation](https://zenodo.org/record/2561849) that I've made for the EPS graduate school council that summarises data and code "tips and tricks" for wet-lab biologists.
