title: "Building your own community of practice"

Together with a list of scientists, I have recently written an article entitled "Building a local community of practice in scientific programming for Life Scientists". This manuscript is under review for PLoS Biology at the time and already available on bioXriv [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/15/265421). 

I have been training myself in bioinformatics and data analysis for some time now here at the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences (University of Amsterdam). During this personal and scientific journey, I was grateful to rely on several scientists knowledgeable in Python, pipeline management systems (Snakemake) or Machine Learning tools (Random Forest). Yet, I had the feeling that a more stable resourceful community needed to be built
