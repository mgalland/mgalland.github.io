## Summary
After nearly a year of intense brainstorming, our story on building Study Groups is out in the open. Sarah and I act as community leads in 
Madison-Wisconsin (USA) and Amsterdam (Netherlands) at our respective Universities. Our communities of practice in scientific programming are 
affiliated to Mozilla Science Lab Study Groups 
foster and support Life Scientists lost under a data avalanche. Communities of practice in scientific programming help to break the impostor
syndrome, network with other researchers engaged in programming and data analysis, break organisation silos that keep different fields and expertise 
separated, etc.
