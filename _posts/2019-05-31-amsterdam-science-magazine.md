## Summary
I had the chance of writing a small article for the [Amsterdam Science Magazine](http://amsterdamscience.org/) that "aims to be a platform that displays the enormous creativity, quality, diversity and enthusiasm of the Amsterdam scientific community. It offers early career scientists (MSc students, PhD candidates, postdoctoral fellows), as well as more advanced researchers, the opportunity to communicate their latest and most interesting findings to a broad audience".   
I explained the origins and goals of the [Amsterdam Science Park Study Group](http://www.scienceparkstudygroup.info/) for a broader audience! I am grateful for this nice opportunity.
