This is a speed-blog post written upon a workshop held at the CarpentryConnect 2019 conference in Manchester.

# Domain-specific issues (Marc)

## Red stickies (issues)
* Open Research: different opinions and definitions. ALthough there is one (ish) term, there are many components to open science/scholarship. Who choses ? What priority?
* Humanities/Library: how to seem relevant/rewarded(?) in my role as library within the community? 
* Mental Health: many studies done on/about a community but without their inclusion. Leads to patronising/offensive badly aligned research goals.
* Librarians: identity as research partners, authority. Not knowing how much data upskilling is required.
* Social sciences: examples of digital scholarship practice that could be applied here e.g. TDM entity extraction for methods that lead to interesting research questions.
* Libraries: difficult to change methods of working to take advantage of new technology (including training staff).
* Librarians: language.
* Data scientists: getting people involved (the community is too broad).
* Humanities: identify the granularity domains to which solutions should be addressed i.e. work in a heterogeneous domain.
* Biology: Lack of prerequisite skills + desire for advanced applications.
* Biology: Lots of conceptual/stats knowledge needed to become proficient.
* Biology: Huge files.
* Biology: Heterogeneous kinds of data, analysis and tools.
* Humanities: engage with researchers about digital practices if they are not involved in them already.
* Human neuroscience: needs lots of data to do the most cutting edge research....but not incentivised to share (1st & last author priority).
* Data Science: people with domain skills don't have a common language so tend to find it hard to work together (talking across, patronising)
* Bioinformatics: standardisation.
* Bioinformatics: software reusability.
* Libraries: engaging a typically non-technical community to become interested in the digital.
* Libraries: skills & knowledge gaps.
* Libraries: Showing values to upper management / stakeholders. 
* Libraries: showing value to upper management / stakeholders.
* Libraries: funding for digital infrastructures & training. 
* Biology: engaging busy academics to participate and keep participating into a domain-specific community. 
* Climate: difficulty to engage them with the Carpentries because they think they know already (have the skills) but the fact is that they did not learn properly and have misconception.
* Making material that can span and be pertinent across multiple domains.
* Longitudinal evaluation of the efficacy of training. 
* Bioinformatics: lack of skills in software engineering.
* Computer science: jargon (gatekeeping - newcomers shy away).
* Assumptions / lack of context (lead to layered complexity). 

## Yellow stickies (untried solutions)
* Start a repo for the issues. Comments in blog?
* Be open. Burn it all to the ground and start over with building/sustaining your community. 
* Host "cross-domain" workshops to bring people with similar data across disciplines.
* Centralize curriculum maintenance & discoverability.

## Green stickies (tried solutions)
None :cry:

# Local issues (Mario)

## Red stickies (issues)

* "I'm not a real programmer. I just write R scripts - I don't need version control/ to share code/...." (impostor syndrome)
* Lack of centralized space
* One person/group/domain dominates a discussion - difficult to find air to breathe for other ideas
* Convenning costs logistics: venue, snacks, man-hours for largely invisible logistcs work
* Even if you're in the same place it doesn't mean you all work [at] the same thing
* Few incentives for local instructors & community today
* Uneven coverage, e.g. Edinburgh vs Glasgow
* How do we coordinate our local activities with global acitivities (online training, lessons maintainance, ... ) ?
* Buy-in from faculty, institutions & funders - protecting and justifying time spent on teaching and learning 
* Instructor/Helper recruitment
* Sustainability of leadership & succession planning
* Engagement/communication between/across research communities
* Funding(constraingts/barriers)/resource access
* Inclusivity/diversity
* Balancing content (eg @meetings)
  specific <----------------|---------------> general
                    "relevant to me or others"
* Laws and policies (certain tools are banned in specific spaces)
* Identify which communities you are in or can/should join
* LixoC(?) Commnity -> Resources in terms of survey and in terms of commitment
* Data sharing in an academic environment
* Embargoes or restricted data - how can this be made open?
* Learning from the outisde
* Helping students from exposure @workshop -> application @ their research
* Getting visibility and support from the University decision-makers (Dean,
  institute directors)
* Assembling a core team of people from different institutes (these institutes being all part of the same university)
* overriding: "not invented here", SILOS solutions
* Local technological constraints
* Training that is sustainable, i.e. where does the support/money come from?
* evolving needs. What happens when our community members outgrow opportunities.
* difficult to coordinate across departments! (even when you're in the same city)

## Green stickies (tried solutions)

* Impostor syndrome. Evidence and validation from peers in co-domains - persistence may be required.
* Design inclusive training. research  communities.
* Outreach + communicate best practice for data software management in research.
* Record your carpentry activities in your institution's CRIS (Current Research Information System) for some measure of credit.
* Inlcude training and learning time as deliverables on grants
* More cross-disciplinary/cross-department communication to break down silos/remove barriers
* free foooooood!! Watch to make sure you have a broad range of dietary requirements, always have non-alcoholic options.

## Yellow stickies (untried solutions)

* Locate "cohorts" of learners that can help each other as they move from exposure -> practice
* Be exlicit about which domains are dominating and LISTEN when under re communities speak. Solicit opinions
* Biggest contributors aare most visible - these are not necessarily the best people to compar ourselves to. Need to allow people to see their contributions in context of whole community.
