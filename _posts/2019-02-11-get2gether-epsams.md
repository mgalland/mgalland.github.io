## Summary
I got invited by the Graduate School Experimental Plant Sciences (EPS) to give a lecture on data management scientific programming and good practices. While mostly aimed at bioinformatics, it is far from being restricted to genomics. The presentation I've shaped was intended to give a good overview of what needs to be learned by the newest generation of life scientists.  
You don't have to be an expert in code to actually benefit from better code and data know-how and good practices!
