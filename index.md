I am a Research Data Manager and Data Scientist living in the Netherlands.

Originally trained as a "wet-lab" Plant Molecular Biologist, I progressively drifted towards Genomics, Data Management and Data Science.   

Presently, I work at the [Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences (University of Amsterdam)](http://sils.uva.nl/) as a support data scientist for experimental researchers. On a day to day basis, I help experimental Life Scientists facing issues in Bioinformatics, Statistics, Data Science and Genomics and participate in optimizing their experiments.

Since 2017, I also coordinate the [Amsterdam Science Park Study Group](https://www.scienceparkstudygroup.info/), a small community of computional biologists that foster the adoption of Open Science practices in daily scientific work. We have received funding from NWO (Dutch Research Council) in 2021 and 2022 to expand our activities. 

Since March 2021, I am a core member of the University of Amsterdam newly established [Data Science Center (DSC)](https://dsc.uva.nl/), applying Machine Learning techniques in Life Sciences and coordinating training activities of the DSC.
